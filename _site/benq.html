<div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
  <p> I'm a content creator from Melbourne Australia currently living the dream in Bali, Indonesia. I love helping brands capture the essence of their personality and really telling a story through my work. </p>
  <p> I split my time between travelling the world, doing photography & videography for brands, and teaching the next generation of content creators through my school <a href="http://www.instituteofcode.com"> the Institute of Code.</a></p>
  <p> I'm also currently creating an online photography course that will teach students from all over the world how to take epic photos & edit them in lightroom and photoshop, which is launching early 2019. </p>

<div class="col-4_sm-12 editable">
  <h2>My Audience  </h2>
</div>
<div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">

  <p>Every single day I have people asking my advice for the perfect photography workflow -- whether it's followers on instagram, students at Institute of Code, or fellow content creators on group trips. I'm always seeking and sharing the latest tools to make life as a photographer easier, and when I find brands that I love, I can't talk about them enough. </p>
  <p> My audience is predominately aspiring photographers, influencers and content creators. It's a premium audience that like to invest in quality (our course is a $4.5k investment), believe in the value of community, and generally love travel and adventure. </p>

<div class="col-4_sm-12 editable">

My work has been featured by BBC, NYtimes, CNN, Discovery and is re-shared by major instagram accounts like @artofvisuals and @moodygrams. Just a few brands that I've worked with include...</p>

      <h2 class="editable">Objective </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
          <p> I really believe that photographers & content creators can dramatically improve their workflow and productivity by using an external monitor. Your monitor in particular, delivers exactly what content creators have been asking for - a color accurate screen with incredible features right out of the box, at a reasonable price. My objective is to help more people get as excited about your product as I am. </p>

    <div class="col-4_sm-12">
      <h2 class="editable">My Pitch </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
          <p> In exchange for gifting 1x 31.5in Professional Design Monitor (PD3220U), I would love to offer you... </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 10x high resolution professionally edited photos showcasing the BenQ Monitor within a professional workflow in a beautiful office </li>
           <li> 1x cinematic unboxing video shared on @eyesofanomad instagram story </li>
           <li> 1x set of stories explaining why I love this monitor and what the features are. </li>
           <li> Dedicated mention in one SEO optimised blog post 'Best Monitor for Photographers' on www.instituteofcode.com blog </li>
           <li> included in a 'My Gear' story highlight for minimum of 12 months </li>
           <li> 1x feature an instagram post with detailed caption about the product </li>
           <li> include in our recommended purchase list for students of my in-person and online courses </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-4_sm-12">
      <h2 class="editable">Why I think we're the perfect fit. </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
      <p> I take my photography very seriously, and only invest in equipment and tools that will help take my content to the next level -- that's something my audience has come to know and expect about me, so they trust that I will only promote the highest quality products that I really believe in.  </p>
      <p> In 2019 I'll be teaching hundreds of students photography through IOC & my online courses, and I know that this is the perfect environment to showcase all the benefits of using a BenQ Monitor. </p>
