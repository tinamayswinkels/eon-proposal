    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
      <p>I really believe that photographers &amp; content creators can dramatically improve their workflow and productivity by using an external monitor. Your UltraSharp monitors in particular, deliver exactly what content creators have been asking for - a colour accurate screen with incredible features right out of the box, all at a reasonable price. My objective is to help more people get as excited about your product as I am.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2 class="editable">My Pitch </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
      <p>In exchange for gifting 1x UltraSharp 27" (PremierColor) Monitor, I would love to offer you...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>10x high resolution professionally edited photos showcasing your stunning monitor within a professional workflow in a beautiful office</li>
        <li>1x 30 second cinematic unboxing video shared on @eyesofanomad instagram story - (shot vertically on a professional camera - which can be made available for your promotion too)</li>
        <li>2x 5+ stories explaining why I love this monitor, what the features are &amp; how it will revolutionise the way content creators work</li>
        <li>Dedicated mention in one SEO optimised blog post 'Best Monitor for Photographers' on www.instituteofcode.com blog</li>
        <li>Included in a 'My Gear' story highlight for minimum of 12 months</li>
        <li>1x feature instagram post with detailed caption about the product</li>
        <li>Included in our recommended purchase list for students of my in-person and online courses</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="editable">Why I think we're the perfect fit. </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
      <p>I take my photography very seriously, and only invest in equipment and tools that will help take my content to the next level -- that's something my audience has come to know and expect about me, so they trust that I will only promote the highest quality products that I really believe in.</p>
      <p>In 2019 I'll be teaching hundreds of students photography through IOC &amp; my online courses, and I know that this is the perfect environment to showcase all the benefits of using a DELL UltraSharp Monitor.</p>
      <p>Beyond these points, I am part of a very active community of high-level content creators here in Bali, that are using Bali as a base to travel the world &amp; return to work in their studios. They often look to me on advice for new gear &amp; I believe that once they see my work flow they will be eager to follow suit.</p>
