      <h2 class="editable">Objective </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
          <p> I really believe that photographers & content creators can dramatically improve their workflow and productivity by using an external monitor. Your monitor in particular, delivers exactly what content creators have been asking for - a color accurate screen with incredible features right out of the box, at a reasonable price. My objective is to help more people get as excited about your product as I am. </p>

    <div class="col-4_sm-12">
      <h2 class="editable">My Pitch </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
          <p> In exchange for gifting 1x 31.5in Professional Design Monitor (PD3220U), I would love to offer you... </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 10x high resolution professionally edited photos showcasing the BenQ Monitor within a professional workflow in a beautiful office </li>
           <li> 1x cinematic unboxing video shared on @eyesofanomad instagram story </li>
           <li> 1x set of stories explaining why I love this monitor and what the features are. </li>
           <li> Dedicated mention in one SEO optimised blog post 'Best Monitor for Photographers' on www.instituteofcode.com blog </li>
           <li> included in a 'My Gear' story highlight for minimum of 12 months </li>
           <li> 1x feature an instagram post with detailed caption about the product </li>
           <li> include in our recommended purchase list for students of my in-person and online courses </li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="editable">Why I think we're the perfect fit. </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
      <p> I take my photography very seriously, and only invest in equipment and tools that will help take my content to the next level -- that's something my audience has come to know and expect about me, so they trust that I will only promote the highest quality products that I really believe in.  </p>
      <p> In 2019 I'll be teaching hundreds of students photography through IOC & my online courses, and I know that this is the perfect environment to showcase all the benefits of using a BenQ Monitor. </p>
